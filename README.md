# New Tab Matrix
A browser extension based on the movie __Matrix__ that modifies the new tab page. Upon opening a new tab animated _matrix digital rain_ known from  the movie is displayed while the theme song is played in the background. This extension is designed for Chromium based browsers only.

__Note:__ Due to  copyright restrictions the theme song is __not__ part of this repository. The user has has to get its own copy of the song and add it manually.

## Installing
1. Open the __Menu__ and navigate to __More Tools__ > __Extensions__ or enter `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar. 
2. Enable the __Developer mode__ temporarily.
3. Click __Load unpacked extension...__ and select the extension's directory.
4. Move your sound file into the __music folder__ (if such a folder does not exist create one in the root directory of the project) an name the file __theme.mp3__. 

## TODOs/ ideas for possible future implementations
* persist user setting (volume, muted sound, animation paused), e.g. add options page
